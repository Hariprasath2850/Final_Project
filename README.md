# Final_Project

Hello there!

Finally completed my final project with four mainstream from different attribute, a oity tough tast! However with solid experience of pervious projects I was able to complete this project on success.
As mentioned before I have given four different project and I am suppose to put all together and showcase in streamlit application! Well, check the below statement to know more.
1. Classification project - This project comprises to build  more than 5 models and predct the end result of target       variable, I have to complete doing process, visualation using bivariant,univariant and multivariant analysis. Then     comes the model prediction and I have did hte model prediction using Random forest, Decision Tree, KNNModel,           Logistic regression, Navie bayes model and XG Boost model. From these models I have chosen Decision tree as my         final model since this model gives me good accuracy and took less time to execute, easy understanding and fits with    all the F1 score, precision, recall and Hence decided with Decision tree.
2. Image processing - The process involves all the activities that can be easily perfomed using PIL library like filtering, bluring, image loading,increase or decrease image sharpness etc...This part is also visualized in streamlit for a complete visualization.
3. NLP - Another mainstream project in my final project, NLP was slightly tougher than ever taught, I completed this task with the help of these EDA process as mentioned Lower word_tokenize,Remove punctuation,stop word,Most frequent word, Lemmatized and showed up these activites in streamlit.
4. Product recommendation - The product recommendation was completly done basis majority of interaction made with the specific product in terms of fotst 50 products and in count of next 100 products, basis these format this taks is been completed.

Well! Well! Well! All the above mentioned about the project are up to my coding skills and please go through the above and reachout to me for any queries and ammendments to me made!

Cheers mate! All the best
