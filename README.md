# Final_Project

Hello there!

I finally completed my final project with four mainstreams from different attributes a pity tough task! However, with solid experience from previous projects, I was able to complete this project successfully.
As mentioned before, I have given four different projects, and I am supposed to put them all together and showcase them in the Streamlit application! Well, check the below statement to know more.
1. Classification project: This project comprises building more than 5 models and predicting the end result of the target variable. I have to complete the process of visualization using bivariant, univariant, and multivariant analysis. Then comes the model prediction, and I have done the model prediction using Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNNModel, Logistic Regression, Navie Bayes Model, and XG Boost Model. From these models, I have chosen the decision tree as my final model since this model gives me good accuracy, takes less time to execute, is easy to understand, and fits with all the F1 scores, precision, and recall. Hence, I have decided on the decision tree.
2. Image processing: The process involves all the activities that can be easily performed using the PIL library, like filtering, blurring, image loading, increasing or decreasing image sharpness, etc. This part is also visualized in streamlit for a complete visualization.
3. NLP: Another mainstream project in my final project, NLP was slightly tougher than ever taught. I completed this task with the help of these EDA processes, as mentioned. Lower word_tokenize, remove punctuation,stop word, most frequent word, lemmatized, and showed up these activities in streamlit.
4. Product recommendation: The product recommendation was completely done based on the majority of interactions made with the specific product in terms of the first 50 products and the count of the next 100 products. Based on these formats, this task has been completed.

Well! Well! Well! All the things mentioned above about the project are up to my coding skills, so please go through them and reach out to me for any queries or amendments I may have made!
Cheers mate! All the best
